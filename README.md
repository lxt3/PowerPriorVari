## Power Prior Variations Repository

Programs and data to accompany "Dynamic Borrowing from a Single Prior Data Source using the Conditional Power Prior".  The EqSim branch was apparently merged with master branch, and deleted, but it is still there.  Master branch is now most current.

Scripts and functions used in the paper are within the mpi_version directory, and will be the most recently changed files.  Please message me if you have a question.
